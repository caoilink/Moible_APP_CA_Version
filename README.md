# Moible_APP_CA_Version

The application I created is a day in the life journal. The applications name is ‘Mapit’. 
The application has full CRUD (create, read, update, delete). 
The application is saved in local persistence using JSON. 
It contains simple validation in the form of checking for a data entry.
I attempted to have my persistence being done through ‘Firebase’. 
Firebase is a platform to add and improve to an application. It is run by Google and is widely used. 
Firebase has a persistence cloud database called Realtime which I tired to sync to my application with no avail. 
However, my application does have persistence in the form of JSON.
It was important to me that I followed the UI guidelines. 
To do this I checked my application met ’Core App Quality’ found on the Android Developer website. 
I found that my application met these guidelines.
